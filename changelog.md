# Changelog

### changes
- added animation to the profile picture (when you click the picture)
- code cleanup
- improvement on the crud and styled crud webpage
- added description on the `.js` and `html` files
- performance improve


### 3<sup>rd</sup> party JavsScript
`anime.js` mostly for animation. I choose `anime.js` over plain css animation because `anime.js` does provide an easier syntax for the same task.  
It is also lightweight and does not require massive 3<sup>rd</sup> party framework to work with.

### futrue 
- code cleanup
- `.js` will be using template string and more compact syntax
- better website design overall
- maybe google tracking
